Code mixing is vital for constructing adaptable sentiment analysis models in complicated 
multilingual environments. 
• The project applies sentiment analysis on a dataset including Tamil, Tulu, and English languages, 
employing complex frameworks like BERT combined with Class Balancing Loss (CBL). 
• This technique yields considerable gains in sentiment analysis accuracy, leading to sophisticated 
language understanding and better healthcare outcomes.
